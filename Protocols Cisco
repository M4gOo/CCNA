===================== CDP ==================================

Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)
They're both very similar protocols.

CDP, Cisco Discovery Protocol, is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 protocol, and it is used to share information
with other directly connected Cisco equipment, such as the operating system and the IP address.
That information will be shared between connected devices. That aids in troubleshooting by allowing administrators
to map out how Cisco devices are connected to each other.

CDP is enabled by default on most Cisco equipment. Not just on routers and switches, also on the firewalls, and even things like software,
like Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) which is used to control IP phones, and even the IP phones as well will run CDP.

CDP works at Layer 2, so it's not necessary for the device to have an IP address on it for it to be detected by its neighbors.

if you want to disable it, 
'no cdp run'
To turn it back on again it's 
'cdp run'

That's done at global configuration. A reason you would maybe want to disable CDP is it can be seen as a security concern.
(config-if) no cdp enable   -> this is for a interface,  will now stop sending out CDP information on that particular interface
(config) no cdp enable      -> If I'm in a highly secured environment and I just want to completely disable CDP on the switch

# show cdp
# show cdp neighbors
# show cdp neighbors detail

you've got a switch on the edge of your network, and you want CDP to be enabled on the internal facing interfaces. 
You want to disable it on the external facing interface so you don't give up information to another organization.
you can do a no cdp enable at the interface level

========================== LLDP ====================================

LLDP is an open standard. So, it's supported on most vendors' devices, and it provides similar information to CDP.

LLDP is only supported on physical interfaces.

CDP is also supported on virtual sub-interfaces as well.

With LLDP, it can only discover up to one device per port. CDP is able to discover multiple devices
per physical port because it does support those virtual sub-interfaces. 

LLDP can discover Linux servers, CDP cannot.

(config) lldp run
(config) no lldp run
(config-if) no lldp transmit
(config-if) no lldp receive
# show lldp
# show lldp neighbors
# show lldp neighbors detail
