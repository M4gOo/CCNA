different memory locations on your device.

There's four built-in memory locations.

First ROM, the Read Only Memory.
Flash. On older devices, that will be installed in the cache on the motherboard. On newer devices, it's a removable CompactFlash card.
NVRAM, the Non-Volatile RAM
RAM the normal Random Access Memory.
You can also use an external USB memory stick plugged into the device as well.

ROM has got two main functions,
First is the Power On Self Test. The POST test will check for any problems with the hardware.
It will then load the bootstrap, and the bootsrap will look in Flash for an IOS software image to load next.
get instructions, just search in Google for 'Cisco ROMMON Recovery' in case is not boot up and to recover the device


To make sure that you get the newer image, the command to use is
'boot system'
'flash' 
and then the system image name. That's a global configuration command. 


When the system has finished loading the IOS system image from Flash, it will then load the start- up config, configuration file from NVRAM, 
and the saved start-up config then becomes the current running-config in RAM.


Whenever you enter a command in IOS, it takes effect immediately and goes into the running-config in RAM. To make your changes permanent across a reboot,
'copy running-config start-up config' command
that copy it into NVRAM, which will be used the next time the system boots up.


VLAN database
That file is the 'vlan.dat' file.
It's just on a switch where it saves the VLAN information, and that is saved in either Flash or NVRAM, depending on the model of the switch.


TFTP server
load a system image and/or startup-config from an external TFTP server rather than from Flash or NVRAM.
That is not recommended, though, because the device will not be able to boot if it loses connectivity to that TFTP server
So, the only reason you would ever really do that is if you want to load a new version of the system
image and there's not enough Flash memory capacity on your device to store that.
Then, you can save it to an external TFTP server instead and boot from there. 



-------------------factory reset and password recovery

factory reset 

the enable prompt (#), we use the 
'write erase' command
That will erase the startup-config. You do that, you then reload the device, and it will boot up with a blank configuration.
There is no startup-config, so the Setup Wizard will then run.


configuration register. 
That is used to change the way that the router boots from the default.
You can use the 
'config-register' command in global configuration mode, or if you're at the ROMMON prompt to where the router or a switch hasn't completed booting yet, 
'confreg' command.

For example, we could use 'config-register 0x2142' for that setting at global config or 'confreg 0x2142' if we were at the ROMMON prompt.
three most useful.
First is 0x2102. That should be the default. The device will boot normally when that is the setting. 
Next one is 0x2120, will boot into ROMMON mode.
Lastly, 0x2142 will ignore the contents of NVRAM while booting, so it will ignore the startup-config.


-----------------password recovery  --google

Always google the steps , because you do once in a while

whatever kind of device is that you need to recover, it will be very, very similar to those instructions below

You need to reboot it.
Then while it is rebooting, press the break sequence on the keyboard. That is commonly Ctrl + Break
during the first minute that the device is powering on, and that will break you into the ROMMON prompt. You then enter the command 
'confreg 0x2142' at the ROMMON prompt, which says to ignore the startup-config on boot
The startup-config is still there, and the full configuration, everything that was configured on that device is there as well
but the router is not going to use that startup-config when it boots up, so you don't need to know what the enable secret is. 
You then enter 'reset' at the ROMMON prompt to boot the device. The router
will boot up with no configuration, so it will enter the Setup Wizard. You then type 'no' to bypass that.
You then enter enable mode with the 'enable' command.
Next thing you need to do is copy the startup-config to the running-config. Do not forget that step. If you forget that step and you do everything else correctly you're going to end up factory resetting that device
then enter a new enable secret in global configuration mode to overwrite the old one, and that will go into the current running-config. 
Then enter 'config-register 0x2102', so the router will boot normally on the next restart.


'enable password' is really a legacy command,
'enable secret' is the new form of doing it.
When you do look at the running-config, 'enable password' is unencrypted by default. 'enabled secret' is always in an encrypted form.
So, that could be a security concern. If you've enabled both 'enable secret' and the 'enable password', then the 'enable secret' overrides the 'enable password'.



==================   backing up the IOS system image and your config file on your router or switch  =======================

You can back up either to an external FTP, or TFTP server, or to a USB stick, or you can back up to Flash in the device.
copy flash tftp
copy running-config tftp
copy running-config usb 

If you do want to restore an old version of the configuration file, you can't just copy it into the startup or running-config because if you do that, it will be merged.
It's not going to replace it
the way that you do that is you, first off, factory reset the device.
You then copy that old config into the startup-config and then reboot, and then you're back with that old config.



========================  upgrade the IOS system image on your Cisco router or switch ============================

First thing that you need to do is get the new software image, so you get that from the Cisco Website
https://software.cisco.com.

download it from the Cisco website, and then copy it onto your TFTP server.
copy tftp flash
Then from the TFTP server, you're going to download it to Flash on the device.
Once you've got it on Flash, then either delete the old image, leaving just the new one there and the device
will now boot up from the new image, or if you want to keep both images on there just in case you need
to fall back to the old one, then to make sure that it uses the new image
use the 'boot system' command.
