------------------- CONFIGURE ROUTER ------------------------------

Your routers provide connectivity between your different IP subnets. That's their main job.

The routers need to have interfaces in the different subnets, and they need to have IP addresses on those interfaces.
Those IP addresses will act as the default gateway address for any hosts that are in that subnet.

to do this from global configuration mode,
we then go to interface configuration mode.
So the command is 'interface FastEthernet0/0', then to put the IP address on there, 
interface fast0/0
ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown                  On our routers, interfaces are shutdown by default, you need to type NO SHUTDOWN

  
The IP address and the subnet mask are both entered with one command, and you have to enter the subnet mask infull dotted decimal notation.

After we have configured this, the router is going to be able to route traffic between those two networks.
As well as being able to route traffic, it also gives IP connectivity to the router itself.
So after we've done this, we would be able to open up a Telnet or SSH client, like Putty, and connect to the router to manage it.  
Once you've got IP addresses on your router, you'll be able to connect to those IP addresses to manage the router remotely from wherever you are.


------------------- CONFIGURE ROUTER ------------------------------

A Layer 2 switch is not IP routing aware.
It does, however, support a single IP address which is used for management. So, you can't put multiple IP addresses on a Layer 2 switch.
so we can again Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH) to the switch remotely to manage it.
Unlike on a router, where we configure the IP address on an interface, on a switch, a Layer 2 switch, the management IP address goes on a VLAN interface which is a virtual interface.
So when we configure our VLAN interface, that's called an SVI, Switched Virtual Interface, and this is going to be in VLAN 1.
switch also needs to be able to get out to that subnet. So just like a normal host would need, it's also going to need to have a default gateway

(conf) interface vlan 1, t
ip address 192.168.0.10 255.255.255.0
no shutdown                                 On a switch, interfaces are enabled by default, but I like to do anyways.
(conf) ip default-gateway 192.168.0.1

configure descriptions on our interfaces
SW(config) interface fastEthernet 0/1
(config-if) description Link to R1      ->helps to troubleshooting, this will tells the interface is connect to R1

We actually need to do some additional commands as well to allow Telnet and/or SSH access into the switch.



===============   interface speed and duplex for ROUTER and SWITCH ======================

a link should auto-negotiate to full duplex and the fastest available speed. It should do that automatically
The default is auto on Cisco devices

Best practice is to manually set the speed and duplex on ports which are connected to another network infrastructure device (router, a switch, or a firewall, or a server)
Because if you set it manually, that is just a little bit more reliable

It's very important to set matching speed and duplex settings on both sides of the link
leave both sides set as auto or set both sides manually

For example, if you've got a server plugged into the switch, you could go on to the switch, and you could manually set the speed and duplex on there.
If you're not sure how to do it on the server, maybe you would just leave it on the server to auto.
That would be a big mistake.
You either have to set it to manual on both sides or auto on both sides.
If you set it to manual on one side and auto on the other, then that will often cause speed and duplex issues, which can bring the link down or lead to terrible performance on the link. 
 if both sides are set to auto, and it doesn't manage to negotiate correctly, that can cause an incorrect speed setting where it's going to run below the optimal speed.

Switch(config) interface fastEthernet 0/1
(config-if) duplex full
(config-if) speed 100

Router(config) interface fastEthernet 0/0   or int fast0/0
(config-if) duplex full
(config-if) speed 100


--------- verify that everything is working as expected
sw1# show running-config   or show run      -> check entire ocnfiguration of the device
show ip interface brief                      -> shows you the status of your interfaces and which IP address is configured on which interface.
show run interface vlan 1                    -> shows specific interface
show interface vlan 1                      -> shows mac addr, packets and so on
show version                                -> can check how many memory is installed into device
