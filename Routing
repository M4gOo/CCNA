A router has got two main functions
that's to determine the best path to available networks, and then to forward actual production traffic to those networks.

The best available path or paths to a destination network are listed in a router's routing table andwill be used for forwarding traffic.
A router may learn lots of different routes, but the best routes into the routing table will be used.

-----------Routing Table
It consists of directly connected networks and routes configured statically by the administrator or dynamically
learned through a routing protocol.
when you do configure the IP addresses on the router's interfaces, it will automatically add routes corresponding
to those into the routing table.
The command to view the routing table on a router is 
'show ip route'

To find out the IP address on the interface, we'd have to
do a 'show ip interface brief' or another similar command to find out that information. 
The show ip route command only shows the subnets available

as soon as you've configured IP addresses on your router interfaces, it can automatically route traffic between those directly connected networks.


Another type of route that is going to show up in your routing table after you've configured IP addresses
on your interfaces is local routes.
these are only going to show up from IOS version 15. Earlier versions did not show these. Local routes always have a /32 subnet mask
From IOS 15, it tells you the subnets that are available on each interface, and
it also tells you the actual IP address that is configured on the interface as well.
