==================== CONCEPTS ==========================

OSI MODEL - The OSI model is a conceptual framework that helps lay out how computer networking protocols should work with each other.
LAN - A Local Area Network is a network that connects devices which are in the same local area, like in a single office or a university campus or house.
CoS - Class of Service helps resolve the problem of network congestion by giving certain types of traffic priority over others. Network congestion occurs when multiple messages are competing for network resources at the same time.
Out of Band Management -  most the large companies do is they'll also have a separate dedicated network for management. Gives you a backup path that you can use
to connect to your network devices if they have any problems and it is more secure.
Production Network (In Band) - it being used for your normal user traffic, the network that is used for your staff in their normal activities.


================ COMMANDS =======================

### short-cut and usefull settings/commands
Ctrl + C - That will break out the command. Dont need to press space bar to see all the commands.
Ctrl + A  - to move to the start of the line
Putty conf scroll - in putty setting adjust 'line of scrollback'
TAB - autocomplete the entire word
DO show ... - use DO in the front in case you are in the global conf, usually show is used in the priv exec mmode
end - back to the priv exec mode
exit - back one level
you dont need worry about case sensitive, only when using pipe (`|`)

### help
? or di?, en?, - If I want to see some commands available (use space bar or enter to see all commands) 
<whatever> ? - it shows you all of the possible keywords for that particular command
sh run | ?

#### often commands
disa (disable) - Router> - user exec prompt   (router is the name of the device, you can rename)
en (enable) - Router# - privileged exec mode  
debug -  the output will be updated in real time
conf t (configure terminal) -  Router#(config) -  To actually make changes, we go to global configuration.
show ip interface brief - show all the interfaces on the router, and the state of the interface, whether it's up or not, the IP address configured on the interface as well
show running-config - that shows the entire configuration on the router
show(sh) run interface <fast0/0> 
sh run | begin hostname  - when use pipe is case sensitive





==========================  TROUBLESHOOTING

if a device just appears to be completely unresponsive, but it is powering on. So, that indicates that the device is probably failing to boot up.
IP address on the device is not live until it has completed the bootup process.


When you do a debug command, what will happen is that the output will be updated in real time.


================== Network Characteristics ================================

topology  -  diagram HOW the devices are connected to each other
speed   - faster is the network more it will cost
cost   -  depends of the type of device are using, size of network, technology using
security  - firewall, in the switches, in the routers, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
availability - make sure it is always stays up, when it is a critical network it is good to double up the components
scalability  - design a network in a way to easy grow, avoiding to redisgn
reliability  - similiar to availability, make sure it is reliable and it is going to work


================== OSI model 

- it is conceptual
- it is just a framework that characterises and standardises how computers communicate with one another over a network
- seven layers
- starts at the top to the bottom (sender) layer -> Encapsulation
- go across the layer 1 the package
- starts at the bottom to the top(receiver) layer -> De-Encapsulation
- helps to troubleshooting, so you can analyse the issue layer by layer 
- helps to learning a new network technology


=================== Layer 7 - APPLICATION

it establishes the availability of intended communication partners. It then synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity. 
Data integrity means checking that data has not been altered or corrupted in transit.

=================== Layer 6 - PRESENTATION

The Presentation Layer can translate among multiple data format using a common format.
Ensures that communications that pass through it are in the appropriate form for the recipient application.

=================== Layer 4 - SESSION

This establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between two communicating hosts. 

For example, we might have web servers which have got many users that are using that web server.
So, in that case, we would have multiple incoming sessions. The Session Layer keeps track of all of those.

It also offers efficient data transfer, Class of Service (CoS), which is similar to efficient data transfer,
and exception reporting of upper layer problems.

Class of Service (CoS) helps resolve the problem of network congestion by giving certain types of traffic priority over others.
Network congestion occurs when multiple messages are competing for network resources at the same time.


=================== Layer 4 - TRANSPORT

TCP\UDP and port nummber
if we want the communication between the two hosts to be reliable - TCP
if speed is more important than reliability (voice or video) - UDP
It breaks down large files into smaller segments that are less likely to incur transmission problems


=================== Layer 3 - NETWORK

IP Address (source and destination)
Routers devices
it provides connectivity and path selection between two host systems that may be located on geographically separated networks. 
The Network Layer is the layer that manages the connectivity of hosts by providing logical addressing. IP addressing is our logical addressing.


=================== Layer 2 - DATA-LINK

MAC Address
Switches devices
The most important information is the source and destination Layer 2 address.
it defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to the physical media is controlled.
It also typically includes error detection on correction to ensure a reliable delivery of the data.


=================== Layer 1 - PHYSICAL 

Hubs devices
it enables bit transmission, the 1s and 0s, between end devices. It defines specifications needed for activating, maintaining, and
deactivating the physical link between end devices. For example, voltage levels, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, and physical connectors, etc.


=================== TCP\IP STACK ===============================================

TCP\IP stack is the main protocol stack used in production. It is also layered
protocol means it is going to control HOW that communication should behave, HOW it should work. 

DATA    - Application layer (OSI model - Application + Presentatiobn + Session): Represents data users, encodes and contols the dialog
SEGMENT - Transport layer (OSI model - Transport): supports communication between end devices across a diverse network
PACKET  - Internet layer (OSI model - Network): provides logical add and determines the best path through the network
Network layer (OSI model - Data Link + Physical): controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network


host communication terminology - data, segment, packet, frame

when 2 hosts talk to each other they are exchanging Protocol Data Units (PDUs). But on daily PDUs are refered as packets
this is the entire communication from layer 7 to layer 1



=========================== OS on CISCO ==============================================

they're all nearly exactly the same!
IOS has got a monolithic kernel, meaning that if one process running on the router crashes, it can crash the entire router. The other newer Operating
Systems have got microkernels, and the processes run in separate, protected memory address space. So if one of the processes crashes, it shouldn't affect the running on the rest of the system.

NX-OS - Cisco Nexus and the MDS Data Centre switches

IOS-XR - On the high-end service provider routers, the NCS and the CRS, and also on the ASR9000 and XR12000 routers

IOS-XE ASR1000 service provider routers


=========================== Connect to the Routers and Switches ==============================================

---------------PuTTy - it is a free software
the protocol used is SSH

You don't want to have to configure all your administrators' usernames and passwords on all 100 of those devices separately.
You want that to be centralized in AAA server. That stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.
It's got access to the central database of all your usernames and passwords, so you'll be having them on each separate device.

Out of Band Management -  most the large companies do is they'll also have a separate dedicated network for management. Gives you a backup path that you can use
to connect to your network devices if they have any problems and it is more secure.
Production Network (In Band) - it being used for your normal user traffic, the network that is used for your staff in their normal activities.


---------------------- make a direct connection using a console cable

Cisco devices do not usually have a default IP address, so we need to set one up before we can connect to it over the network
need to select your correct COM port on your computer when you open the Putty software. To find this information openDevice Manager in Windows, and then look in your ports here, and you'll see the com port, and it's usually COM3

You'll often see that it comes in useful for troubleshooting as well using console cable
