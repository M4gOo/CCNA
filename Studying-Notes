==================== CONCEPTS ==========================

OSI MODEL - The OSI model is a conceptual framework that helps lay out how computer networking protocols should work with each other.
LAN - A Local Area Network is a network that connects devices which are in the same local area, like in a single office or a university campus or house.
CoS - Class of Service helps resolve the problem of network congestion by giving certain types of traffic priority over others. Network congestion occurs when multiple messages are competing for network resources at the same time.
Out of Band Management -  most the large companies do is they'll also have a separate dedicated network for management. Gives you a backup path that you can use
to connect to your network devices if they have any problems and it is more secure.
Production Network (In Band) - it being used for your normal user traffic, the network that is used for your staff in their normal activities.
QoS - Quality of Service is, you might have one particular type of traffic that requires a better level of service than another level of traffic.

================ COMMANDS =======================

### short-cut and usefull settings/commands
Ctrl + C - That will break out the command. Dont need to press space bar to see all the commands.
Ctrl + A  - to move to the start of the line
Putty conf scroll - in putty setting adjust 'line of scrollback'
TAB - autocomplete the entire word
DO show ... - use DO in the front in case you are in the global conf, usually show is used in the priv exec mmode
end - back to the priv exec mode
exit - back one level
you dont need worry about case sensitive, only when using pipe (`|`)
reload - reboot the device
invalid  input error - check if you are at the right level or it is a typo
ip route - output default via means default gateway in linux
show ip interface - show the default gateway on cisco 
ip subnet-zero - disables removing 2 networks (all 0's and all 1's)


### help
? or di?, en?, - If I want to see some commands available (use space bar or enter to see all commands) 
<whatever> ? - it shows you all of the possible keywords for that particular command
sh run | ?


#### often commands
disa (disable) - Router> - user exec prompt   (router is the name of the device, you can rename)
en (enable) - Router# - privileged exec mode  
debug -  the output will be updated in real time
conf t (configure terminal) -  Router#(config) -  To actually make changes, we go to global configuration.
do show startup-config - startup configuration, any change it will be permanently even after reboot
show running-config - that shows the entire running configuration on the router
show ip interface brief - show all the interfaces available in the router, and the state of the interface, whether it's up or not, the IP address configured on the interface as well
show(sh) run interface <fast0/0> 
sh run | begin hostname  - when use pipe is case sensitive
show mac address-table dynamic - view dynamic table mac add table in the switch
clear mac address-table dynamic - clear dynamic table mac add table in the switch. Usually switch will periodically flush old entries



==========================  TROUBLESHOOTING

if a device just appears to be completely unresponsive, but it is powering on. So, that indicates that the device is probably failing to boot up.
IP address on the device is not live until it has completed the bootup process.


When you do a debug command, what will happen is that the output will be updated in real time.

Check TCP/IP is working use the command ping

========================= BACKUP CONFIGURATION =========================

copy run start - Router# - being copied to the startup configuration, so change made in starup-config it will persistent.
copy run flash:, then press ENTER, after type the name of your start configuration <my-config> - back up the configuration. 
sh flash - To verify the copied configuration
If I wanted to restore from this backup, first erase the start up configuration, because if you copy it will merge and not replace the commands.
erase start or write erase (old versions)
copy flash:<my-config> start

This way you made a backup in the same device, which is not a good idea. So it is better to back it up somewhere else.
The easiest way to do that would be to copy the running configuration to a TFTP server. You need to have this server on
copy run tftp

Check the content of my backup. That will print out here what the contents of that configuration file are.
more flash:<my-config>


================== Network Characteristics ================================

topology  -  diagram HOW the devices are connected to each other
speed   - faster is the network more it will cost
cost   -  depends of the type of device are using, size of network, technology using
security  - firewall, in the switches, in the routers, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
availability - make sure it is always stays up, when it is a critical network it is good to double up the components
scalability  - design a network in a way to easy grow, avoiding to redisgn
reliability  - similiar to availability, make sure it is reliable and it is going to work


================== OSI model 

- it is conceptual
- it is just a framework that characterises and standardises how computers communicate with one another over a network
- seven layers
- starts at the top to the bottom (sender) layer -> Encapsulation
- go across the layer 1 the package
- starts at the bottom to the top(receiver) layer -> De-Encapsulation
- helps to troubleshooting, so you can analyse the issue layer by layer 
- helps to learning a new network technology


=================== Layer 7 - APPLICATION

it establishes the availability of intended communication partners. It then synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity. 
Data integrity means checking that data has not been altered or corrupted in transit.

=================== Layer 6 - PRESENTATION

The Presentation Layer can translate among multiple data format using a common format.
Ensures that communications that pass through it are in the appropriate form for the recipient application.

=================== Layer 5 - SESSION

This establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between two communicating hosts. 

For example, we might have web servers which have got many users that are using that web server.
So, in that case, we would have multiple incoming sessions. The Session Layer keeps track of all of those.

It also offers efficient data transfer, Class of Service (CoS), which is similar to efficient data transfer,
and exception reporting of upper layer problems.

Class of Service (CoS) helps resolve the problem of network congestion by giving certain types of traffic priority over others.
Network congestion occurs when multiple messages are competing for network resources at the same time.


=================== Layer 4 - TRANSPORT

TCP\UDP and port nummber
if we want the communication between the two hosts to be reliable - TCP
if speed is more important than reliability (voice or video) - UDP
It breaks down large files into smaller segments that are less likely to incur transmission problems

it provides transparent transfer of data between hosts and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control.
flow control - adjusting the flow of data from the sender to ensure that the receiving host can handle all of it. The sender send a signla to slow down


multiplexing - This is a process by which a host is able to support multiple sessions simultaneously and manage the individual traffic streams over a single link.
It's the Layer 4, the Transport Layer, that is responsible for tracking (use the combination of source (usually is above 1024 and it  is random number) and destination port numbers) 
and keeping control of the different sessions on a host. 
The tracking system is how stateful firewalls are able to keep track of connections as well

Explaining how multiplexing works:
- sender on the left, and there's going be a couple of receivers over on the right.
- The sender sends some email, SMTP traffic, to the top receiver on port 25, and it also sends
some web traffic on HTTP port 80 to the bottom receiver, and it's also sending email traffic on port 25 to the bottom receiver as well. 
- from the sender on the left, we've got three sessions from it. 
The top receiver on the right, we've got one session
the bottom receiver we've got two sessions


TCP ---------------------------------

The way that connection-oriented is set up between the two hosts is it uses the TCP three-way handshake.
It sends a SYN, a Synchronized Message, over to the receiver. When the receiver receives that, it will send SYN-ACK back, so a Synchronized Acknowledgment,
and then finally, to complete the connection, the sender will send an acknowledgment, ACK. So, connection set up between the two hosts, and they can send traffic over it.

TCP carries out sequencing, so it includes sequence numbers in the traffic to ensure that segments are processed in the correct order, and none are missing.
So when traffic comes into the receiver, it can look at the sequence number, and it can use that to make sure it assembles the traffic in the correct order again.

TCP is reliable. It can also check from the sequence numbers if a segment was lost in transit as well. 
Receiving host sends acknowledgments back to the sender. So based on the sequence numbers, the receiver can see
if all the traffic has come in. If any traffic is being lost in transit, then it will tell the sender that happened. 
The way it does it is by not sending an acknowledgment back to the sender. When a sender realizes that traffic is being lost, it will resend that traffic again

TCP can also perform flow control, if the sender is sending a rate too high and the receiver cannot handle it, the receiver can signal back to the sender, telling it to slow down. 


UDP ---------------------

we don't have the connection, we don't have reliability.
The sender just makes up the packet, sends it over to the receiver, and hopes that it's going to get there.
So UDP, it's not connection-oriented.
There's no handshake connection setup between the hosts. It doesn't carry out sequencing to ensure
segments are processed in the correct order or missing. It's not reliable. The receiving host does not send
acknowledgments back to the sender. It does not perform flow control.

UDP is used in Voice and video, it's very sensitive to delay. 
Watching the news report where the newscaster is doing it over a satellite phone (it's very laggy because satellites are famously high latency connections)
So voice and video, it's very sensitive to latency.
We don't want to use TCP for real-time traffic like that because the extra overhead is going to slow it down, and it's going to affect the quality.


=================== Layer 3 - NETWORK

IP Address (source and destination)
Other Layer 3 protocols apart from IP include ICMP, which is the Internet Control Message Protocol, which is used for ping.

troubleshooting
Routers devices 
they can direct traffic between your different IP subnets.
Routers support many different types of interfaces such as Ethernet, Serial, ISDN, and ADSL

The Network Layer is the layer that manages the connectivity of hosts by providing logical addressing. IP addressing is our logical addressing.

Layer is responsible for routing packets to their destination on the network
it's also responsible for Quality of Service as well.
Quality of Service is, you might have one particular type of traffic that requires a better level of service than another level of traffic.


The network designer uses IP addressing to partition the overall network into smaller subnetworks, or commonly called subnets. By having different subnets,
it improves performance and security and makes troubleshooting easier. 

IPv6 address space is actually 7.9x10 to the power of 28 times as many addresses as IPv4

layer 3 header------------------------

Maximum size by default in Ethernet is a 1500 byte MTU.
If we try a packet onto the wire that is larger than that size, it has to get split up into smaller parts which are called our fragments.

The second row of information on the IP header is used to help keep track of those fragments.

The next row down, we have an 8-bit time to live (TTL) field.
Every time a packet goes through a router, the router will decrement the TTL field by one.
If it gets down to zero, then that router will drop the packet, this is for is to prevent routing loops.

checksum which is used to check that packet has not been corrupted in transit.



=================== Layer 2 - DATA-LINK

ethernet protocol
ARP protocol
MAC Address -  48-bit hexadecimal address. If we look back a slide, 6 Bytes, each Byte is 8 bits, so 6 times 8 = 48 bits
MAC address is split into two different halves, as concerns what makes up the MAC address. The first half,
so the first 24 bits, is the OUI. That's the Organizationally Unique Identifier, and that identifier is the manufacturer of the Ethernet port.
The second half of the address, so the last 24 bits, that is assigned by the manufacturer. The burned in MAC address on every NIC port in the world is globally unique.
no logical addressing with your MAC addresses. It's just one big flat address space

to check mac address on cisco devices - show interface (on priv exec). it will show Hardware XXX, address <MAC ADDRESS NUMBER>

Switches devices
Switches will typically only support Ethernet interfaces.
it is very common to have Layer 3 switches routing the traffic which is within the different subnets on your Local Area Network.
However, if your connection outside that campus, out to the Wide Area Network, is using an interface type which is not Ethernet, then you would still require a normal traditional router for that traffic as well.
The most important information is the source and destination Layer 2 address.
it defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to the physical media is controlled.
It also typically includes error detection on correction to ensure a reliable delivery of the data.


Whenever a frame is received, the switch will look at the source MAC address in the Layer 2 Ethernet header, and it will learn that MAC address
Whenever a frame is received for the broadcast address or an unknown unicast address, it would be unknown because the switch hasn't learned about it yet, it will be flooded out all ports
apart from the one it was received on. 

=================== Layer 1 - PHYSICAL 

ethernet protocol
Hubs can't  send or receive at the same time withou collision
Hubs devices it is half duplex, they dont have detecting and recovering from collisions which is CSMA/CD (Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection), this avoid colision. 
it enables bit transmission, the 1s and 0s, between end devices. It defines specifications needed for activating, maintaining, and
deactivating the physical link between end devices. For example, voltage levels, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, and physical connectors, etc.


the difference between the Categories (cat5, cat6,cat7,...) have got support for higher bandwidth connections.
cat5 vs cat6 - cat is twisted thighter and have a plastic guid in the middle of the cable

What is common using crossover cables is connecting your switches to each other, nowadays modern swtiches can use normal cables (just check if supports Auto MDI-X)

RJ-45 Connector will plug directly into the switch. But fiber connectors, they'll normally go into a transceiver, which then goes into the switch.



=================== TCP\IP STACK ===============================================

TCP\IP stack is the main protocol stack used in production. It is also layered
protocol means it is going to control HOW that communication should behave, HOW it should work. 

DATA    - Application layer (OSI model - Application + Presentatiobn + Session): Represents data users, encodes and contols the dialog
SEGMENT - Transport layer (OSI model - Transport): supports communication between end devices across a diverse network
PACKET  - Internet layer (OSI model - Network): provides logical add and determines the best path through the network
FRAME - Network layer (OSI model - Data Link + Physical): controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network


host communication terminology - data, segment, packet, frame

when 2 hosts talk to each other they are exchanging Protocol Data Units (PDUs). But on daily PDUs are refered as packets
this is the entire communication from layer 7 to layer 1


=========================  unicast, broadcast, and multicast

Three main types of traffic that will send over an IP network

Unicast traffic - it's coming from a sender, and it's going to one particular host.
Broadcast traffic - goes to all hosts on the subnet. the sender sends one copy of the traffic that will come into the switch, and then it gets flooded out to all other hosts on that particular part of the network. 
if the traffic hit the router, it will not forward broadcast traffic on.
Multicast traffic goes to multiple interested hosts - we send one copy that goes to multiple different destinations (we've got good bandwidth savings there!!!!)


broadcast VS muticast

broadcast traffic goes to everywhere on that particular part of the network, whether the receiver has requested it or not. 
Multicast goes through multiple receivers, but it's targeted. They have to request it before they're going to actually get it. 

A good analogy for multicast traffic is, you can think of it like tuning into a radio station. So all of the different receivers, they've tuned in that particular station, they're going to get that particular traffic.


============================ BINARY

Decimal 0 - 9,  every column add is multiple by 10
Binary 0 - 1, every column add is multiple by 2


IPv4 - 32 bits long, 4 octets ( each octet is 8 bits long)
Each octet in the IP address has a value ranging from 0 to 255.

8 bits -  128  |  64  |  32 |  16  |  8  |   4  |  2  |  1
2^0 - 1
2^1 - 2
2^2 - 4
2^3 - 8
2^4 - 16
2^5 - 32
2^6 - 64
2^7 - 128


============================ SUBNET MASK

To set the boundary between our logical networks, our subnets, the IP address is going to be combined with a subnet mask

A host can send traffic directly to another host on the same subnet via the switches they're attached to. 
But for a host to send traffic to another host in a different subnet, it must be forwarded by a router.
Routers are our devices that link our different subnets together and route the traffic between them

the way that the host knows whether the destination is on the same subnet or a different subnet is by comparing the IP address of the destination to its own IP address and the subnet mask.


A host's IP address is divided into a 
network portion and a host portion
it's the subnet mask that defines where the boundary is between the network part and the host part of the address.
A '1' in the subnet mask indicates that bit in the IP address is part of the network address, and a '0' indicates that the bit is part of the host address.


there's two particular addresses that can not be assigned to a host.
All 0's in the host portion designates the network address and is not allowed to be allocated to a host. All 0's signifies the network address, which is the bottom address in the range. 
All 1's, which is the top address in the range, that is the directed broadcast. Whenever you send traffic to the directed broadcast address, it goes to all hosts in that subnet


-------------- Classes A, B,C, D, E, F

### Class A addresses are assigned to networks with a very large number of hosts, there's going to be a small network portion and a large host portion. /8
1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.254 (1 - 126)
2^24 - 6,777,214 hosts per network.
it's the first bits in the address are always going to be set to 0
all 0s and 127 are not in the valid address range that we can assign to our hosts because they are reserved addresses. 
0.0.0.0/8 is reserved and signifies 'this network', and it's used by some protocols. So, 0.0.0.1 to 0.255.255.255 are not valid addresses that you can assign to hosts.
127.0.0.0/8, which is also in the Class A space, is also reserved. That is used as the loopback address, and it's used for testing the IP stack on the local computer.


### Class B were originally assigned to medium to large-sized networks
it's the first two bits in the address are always going to be set to 1 0
default subnet mask is /16
128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0 (128 - 191)


### Class C is used for small networks
They're always set to binary 1 1 0.
default subnet mask is /24
192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0 (192 - 223)


### Class D is used for multicast addresses.
the four high-order bits, the first four bits, in the first octet are always set to the binary value of 1 1 1 0
224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (224 - 239)
These Class D addresses, they're not allocated to hosts, and there's no default subnet mask
With multicast traffic, we're going to send one copy of the traffic from 10.10.10.10, and that one copy
is going to get sent to 10.10.10.15 and 10.10.20.15 as well.
We are going to run an application on the sender, which is going to send it as multicast traffic, and in
our example, we're going to send it to a destination multicast address of 239.0.0.1.
It still comes from the same source address of 10.10.10.10, and the destinations still have their normal unicast addresses there as well,
but we send it to this special multicast address. That will then go to all of the hosts that were interested in getting that traffic.


### Class E addresses, they are experimental and reserved for future use.
The first bits in a Class E are always set to 1 1 1 1.
240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255. (240 - 255)
these addresses do not have a default subnet mask.
There is one special address used in Class E, which is the broadcast address of 255.255.255.255.


----------------- PRIVATE ADDRESSES

IETF, that's Internet Engineering Task Force, in RFC 1918. 
Private IP addresses were originally for hosts that should not be connected to the Internet.
There's also a range of reserved private addresses in each class.
Those are valid to be assigned to hosts, these ones are not routable on the public Internet.
So, these were originally designed for hosts in a closed private network that should have no Internet connectivity.

CLASS  A - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255      - subnetmask is /8
CLASS  B -  172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255   - subnetmask is /12
CLASS  C - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255  - subnetmask is /16


if you're using a private IP address on the inside, whenever you communicate with anybody out on the public
Internet, when the traffic gets to them, it looks like it's coming from a public IP address,so they're able to send the traffic back to you.
And many hosts in the inside, so many hosts in the inside using those private IP addresses, can share a few or even just a single public IP address on the outside.

you can not send traffic to a private IP address on the Internet. Because all the different companies are using those
private IP addresses, the Internet would not know which one to send it to. Therefore, internal use within the organization only. 


============================= SUBNETING ============================================
http://www.subnet-calculator.com/
http://www1.subnettingquestions.com/
https://subnetting.org/
https://subnettingpractice.com/subnets.html

---------------- CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing

CIDR removed the fixed /8, /16, and /24 requirements for the different advanced classes and allowed them to be split into smaller networks, and the name for this is subnetting. 


Summarization -  ISP B only learns one route to all the networks behind ISP A rather than learning 256,and ISP B will vice versa just advertise one route of 175.11.0.0/16 to ISP A.
The benefits we get from summarization is that ISP A doesn't know about all 256 networks behind ISP B. It only gets a single summary route that covers all of them.
It's more efficient, it takes up less memory in the router. And if an individual link goes down in an ISP B, it doesn't have any impact on ISP A because that one summary route doesn't change. 
Compartmentalizing the different parts of our network, and if we've got an issue in part A of the network, it's not going to impact part B of the network.


we can buy a single class C range, and then we can divide that network up into smaller networks and assign it to the different parts of our networks.
we've got that Class C range, and it is 200.15.10.0/24, the default Class C subnet mask. So to do our subnetting, to divide that network into smaller subnets,
we need to borrow some host bits and add them to the network portion of the address.
To calculate the number of available subnets that we're going to get by moving the line to the right, we use a formula of 2 to the power of subnet bits.
If a Class C network uses a /28 subnet mask, then we've borrowed 4 bits from the default of /24
the difference between 24 and 28 is 4. The way we calculate how many subnets we're going to get by doing that is it's 2 to the power of the amount of SUBNET BITS THAT WE'VE BORROWED.
it's 2 to the power of 4
I'm going to now have 16 available subnets.

To calculate the number of hosts, it's 2 to the power of how many HOSTS BTIS THERE ARE minus 2. (subtract 2 because we've got the network address and the broadcast address that can not be assigned to hosts)


remember that hosts on different subnets need to go via a router if they want to communicate with each other.


------------------- /31 - Cisco allowed that exception. broadcast and network address
A /31 subnet breaks the standard rules of IP addressing, where we have to have the network address and the broadcast address at the top and the bottom of the range.
on Cisco routers /31 is supported for point to point links means there's this one side and the other side.
Well, any traffic that comes from here needs to go at the other side, and vice versa. There's nowhere else for it to go, so there isn't really any point in having a network and a broadcast address.


------------------ /31 VS /30
/31 supported a 128 subnetworks
/30 only supported 64

Better to use a /31. This is useful if you need to maximize the use of your address space.
But a /30 is more commonly used, it's more standardized. For the CCNA exam always use a /30.
If the question requires you to come up with a subnet that supports 2 hosts, use a /30 unless the question explicitly tells you to use a /31.

---------------- /24
with the subnetting is /25 it will split the networkss by 2 and divide by 2 the hosts
/25 - 2 networks and 126 hosts (the other 2 is broadcast and network)
/26 - 4 networks and 62 hosts  (the other 2 is broadcast and network)
...


----------------- Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM).
With early routing protocols, like RIPv1, they only supported Fixed Length Subnet Masks (FLSM), which meant you could subnet, but all subnets in a particular network had to be the same size.
You couldn't mix and match /27, /28, /29 within the same larger network, but that ended up wasting a lot of addresses.
support for Variable Length Subnet Masks means that within the same range, you can have different sizes of subnets
we can use different length subnet masks within the same network. 
This is a good thing because it lets us be much more precise with the size of our networks, and we're going to be wasting a lot less addresses.



========================= DESIGN THE SUBNETTING ==========================================

The things that we need to consider when we're going to do the design are:

how many different locations do we have in the network that are going to need subnets and how many hosts are going to be in each of those subnets?
What are the IP addressing requirements for each of the different locations?
So should different departments or types of hosts to be in different subnets?

#  in a real world deployment, you want to have a scalable design.
# Do 3 or 4 subnets of XX hosts because then if you do have a new department that requires up to XX hosts later, you've got a spare subnet there waiting for it,
and everything is still sequential and contiguous, logical, going from largest down to smallest. (To find the XX number check your largest hosts in your design and add 2 or thress spare, it will cover
further company growth).
#  in the real world is you would also allocate address space for your loopback addresses. Loopback addresses are used for management. They're a logical address,
so there's no anything physical on the other, so we'll usually allocate a /32 to our loopback addresses.
# On network diagram put the network address IPs in every department and routers(devices) and next to the routers the first available host for the particular network address.
# Summarization - We connect the two routers between Region A and Region B. And from Region A, we can advertise 10.0.0.0/16, and from Region B, originate,
we advertise 10.1.0.0/16. So rather than advertising all 256 routes in both directions, we only advertise one route.
So it takes up less memory on the routers because we've got less routes that are known to therouters, and also, 
if there's a problem, the impact, there's a little call to that particular region. To be able
to do this, you need to be careful with the way that you plan your network addressing, and you need to make
sure that you allocate them in contiguous blocks like you see here. 

----------------- subnetting larger networks

4th octet
Class B it is /16 with /29 gives 6 hosts and 8192 (2^13  it is 13 cuz 29-16) subnets
Class A it is /8 with /28 gives 14 hosts and 1048576 (2^20  it is 20 cuz 28-8) subnets

3rd octet
Lets use the IP addr 60.15.10.75/19
Class A it is /8 with /19 gives 8190 (2^13 -2) hosts and 2048 (2^11  it is 11 cuz 19-8) subnets
The bondary between network and hosts is in the third octet just after 32 ( 128  |  64  |  <32> ||  16  |  8  |   4  |  2  |  1 ),
this means the  network address goes up in multiple of 32.
network 60.15.0.0, next network is 60.15.32.0
broadcast 60.15.31.255
hosts 60.15.0.1 to 60.15.31.254

magic number method. It was a /19, that's 3 bits on the 3rd octet.
So that is 128, 192, and then 224.
We subtract 224 from 256, which gives us 32 so that we know the address block is going up in values of 32.


134.65.0.0 into 6 different network 
134 it is class B, so /16 default. network 2^3 = 8 meaning /19, it will provide 8 subnets and 2^13-2=8190 hosts
network it will be 134.65.0.0, 134.65.32.0, 134.65.64.0


=============================== DNS =====================================================

layer 3, the sender has to put on the source and the destination IP address. Now with some applications, it will actually put the IP address directly in there, but quite often,
it will use an FQDN, a Fully Qualified Domain Name, such as www.cisco.com, and that FQDN hasto be resolved to an IP address that we can put into the packet.
So, that is where DNS comes in!!!!

Enterprises will typically have an internal DNS Server or a cluster of internal DNS Servers, which will resolve the IP addresses of their internal hosts.
if I was working for an enterprise called www.company.com, we would have our own internal DNS Server, which would be responsible for resolving all hosts that were in the www.company.com domain.
However, that internal DNS Server, it can't know about everything on the entire Internet.
It can't have the entire database there. So for anything external, it's going to need to forward those requests onto an external public DNS Server.
DNS requests are sent using UDP port 53


------------ configure DNS on cisco router
you will not usually want a Cisco router to be a DNS server. Usually, you would use an external Windows, or Unix or Linux server to do that, but it is capable of doing it.

The commands to configure a router to be a DNS Client. The reason you would do this is if you want the router itself to be able to resolve FQDNs.
So often, we won't do that. Often, when we're working on a router, we're always going to be working with IP addresses.

need to be in global conf level

want it to be able to resolve hostnames, the commands to enter are ip domain-lookup
to allow it to look up a DNS server ip name-server
the IP address of your DNS server ip domain-name server.lab
lookup additional DNS suffixes ip domain-list server.lab, and then those additional suffixes

If you wanted a router to be your DNS Server,then to configure that, you would enter those same commands plus 
ip dns server
is the command that configure it as a DNS server, and then you would need to enter address records for everything that you want it to be able to resolve. 
The command for that is 
ip host namehost IPhost 
and then the hostname and the IP address of that host.


=============================  DNS  + layer2 (MAC)  ------   ARP Address Resolution Protocol  ======================================

the sender can either send directly to an IP address or it can send to an FQDN. If it sends to that Fully Qualified Domain Name, then that will need to be resolved into the IP address using DNS.
So we'll find the destination IP address, then when the packet gets down to Layer 2, the sender also needs to know the destination MAC address.
So when it composes a packet, it needs to know both the destination IP address and the MAC address as well
FQDN, which can be resolved by DNS. But the MAC address, on the other hand, is not a logical address.
We need a protocol that's going to be able to figure out what the MAC address is automatically, and that's what ARP is 
it will send out an ARP request, which is a Layer 2 broadcast.
ARP replies are saved in a host ARP cache so that it doesn't need to send an ARP request every time it wants to communicate
with somebody else. To view the ARP cache, we can do that 
on Windows with the 'arp -a' command. clear cache netsh interface ip delete arpcache
On a Linux host, we use the 'arp -n' command clear cache ip -s -s neigh flush all


=========================== OS on CISCO ==============================================

they're all nearly exactly the same!
IOS has got a monolithic kernel, meaning that if one process running on the router crashes, it can crash the entire router. The other newer Operating
Systems have got microkernels, and the processes run in separate, protected memory address space. So if one of the processes crashes, it shouldn't affect the running on the rest of the system.

NX-OS - Cisco Nexus and the MDS Data Centre switches

IOS-XR - On the high-end service provider routers, the NCS and the CRS, and also on the ASR9000 and XR12000 routers

IOS-XE ASR1000 service provider routers

For the device to boot up, it needs to initially load the IOS operating system image, and that is stored in Flash.
Once the operating system is up and running, then it will load your actual administrator configuration
from the startup configuration, and the startup configuration is stored in NVRAM.
That's non-volatile memory,so it's persistent across a reboot. 

=========================== Connect to the Routers and Switches ==============================================

---------------PuTTy - it is a free software
the protocol used is SSH

You don't want to have to configure all your administrators' usernames and passwords on all 100 of those devices separately.
You want that to be centralized in AAA server. That stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.
It's got access to the central database of all your usernames and passwords, so you'll be having them on each separate device.

Out of Band Management -  most the large companies do is they'll also have a separate dedicated network for management. Gives you a backup path that you can use
to connect to your network devices if they have any problems and it is more secure.
Production Network (In Band) - it being used for your normal user traffic, the network that is used for your staff in their normal activities.


---------------------- make a direct connection using a console cable

Cisco devices do not usually have a default IP address, so we need to set one up before we can connect to it over the network
need to select your correct COM port on your computer when you open the Putty software. To find this information openDevice Manager in Windows, and then look in your ports here, and you'll see the com port, and it's usually COM3

You'll often see that it comes in useful for troubleshooting as well using console cable




========================= FIREWALL ============================

The Cisco firewall is the ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance)
The IPS, the Intrusion Prevention System, from Cisco is the SourceFire

This is how stateful firewalls are able to keep track of connections as well.
Imagine that rather than a switch in the middle there,
if it was a firewall, and we had a rule in the firewall that said traffic is allowed out from the sender
on the left out to the network on the right,
but traffic is not allowed from the right to the left unless it was initiated from the sender.
If you manage to follow that, well, in that case, on the firewall, we're allowing traffic from the sender
to the receiver. That traffic is allowed outbound. When the return traffic comes back, the firewall could
see based on the source and destination port numbers, "Oh, this is return traffic going back to that
sender again,
so I'll allow this traffic to come through." If your traffic had been initiated by the host on the right,
it would not allow that traffic. Okay, so that's how stateful firewalls work



=================== DATA CENTER ==================================

UCS stands for Unified Computing System, as well as the blade server that you see here. Cisco also have standard rackmount servers as well.
With the UCS, Cisco moved into offering compute as well, where you can actually run your servers
directly on Cisco hardware.
The other main product that Cisco have for the Data Center market is the Nexus Switches.
These are very similar to the standard Cisco Switches, which run the IOS software.
They do exactly the same job, but these are often a bit higher-end switches, and they run the NX-OS software instead.


=================== IP PBX ======================================

A lot of modern companies still are using traditional PBXs, but IP PBXs are getting more and more popular.
Cisco's Unified Communications Manager is one of the most popular IP PBXs
