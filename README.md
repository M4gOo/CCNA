STUDYING FOR CCNA 200-301

Most of the knowledge I learned came from the internet. For me, it is important to continue contributing and helping others, as this strengthens our community. Therefore, I have compiled information from different sources to learn and prepare myself well for the CCNA exam.

I have decided to really understand and create a solid basic fundantion in networking. 

This experience has boosted my confidence.

I wish you all the best and good luck! Have Fun!
